2. **Run the Setup Wizard:** After activation, WooCommerce will launch a setup wizard to guide you through the process of setting up your store. This includes setting your store location, currency, payment methods, and shipping options.

## Managing Products

WooCommerce provides a detailed interface for managing your products. Here's a basic rundown of how to add a product:

1. **Add a new product:** From your WordPress dashboard, go to Products > Add New. Here, you'll be able to enter the product name, description, product category, and product image.
